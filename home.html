        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Cody and I am an aspiring programmer who is still learning and honing my craft! Here you will be able to see what projects I am working on,
          as well as what I have done in the past!</p>
        <br>
        <p>My biggest goal is to work my way up from being a junior engineer to a senior engineer and eventually work in the cybersecurity field. My biggest goal at the moment is to get my first job in programming
          to grow my skills and show what an asset I can be to any company I join.</p>  
        <br>
        <p>In my free time I enjoy gaming, playing guitar and working on some projects. I have been interested in programming since I was a teenager but I finally gained the courage to take the steps into becoming a programmer!</p>
        <br>
        <p>So I hope you enjoy your time here on my island in the internet. I will be constantly updating what I am working on and what I have completed.</p>

          <h3>W.I.P Patient Database</h3>
          <p>This is the current project I am working on in my freetime. I currently don't have much done as I am
            moving the code from python to html/css/javacsript. I will post more as it gets done!
